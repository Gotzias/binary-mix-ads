We use the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) to calculate the mixture adsorption selectivity of porous solids at a range of feed temperatures and mixture compositions. IAST calculations use a set of single component adsorption data which result from either experimental measurments or grand canonical simulations at the conditions of interest. To express the effect of the temperature on the adsorption selectivity, we use the Clausius - Clapeyron equation to extrapolate the available isotherms at different temperatures. IAST is then employed on the extrapolated single component isotherms to compute the uptake capacities for the mixture components. We show case the method by computing the adsorption of $CO_2$-$CH_4$ mixtures at temperatures between 270 and 320 K. As representative adsorbents we consider two activated carbons and two metal organic framework crystals.
